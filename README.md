- ðŸ«¡ Hi, Iâ€™m @Phixsuraï¼Œa third-year university student in China, currently employed at @ByteDance.
- ðŸ¤’ I am proficient in Java, Golang, and Rust.
- ðŸ¤ª After some reflection, I've realized that my previous pursuit of technologies like distributed microservices and cloud native was misguided. Instead, I'm now fully committed to working on my entrepreneurial idea, and we're on track to launch an MVP version soonï½ž
- ðŸ¤® However, I've also come to understand the harsh realities of China's heavily KPI-driven open source community. As a result, I'm now focusing my efforts on more meaningful endeavors that align with my values and goals.
